The ITK-Snap GUI
================

---------------

ITK-Snap is run primarily from the Graphical User Interface. Once you load an image, you are able to make edits to the image, labeling voxels with different values as you see fit.

Let us continue with our example from the Infant Brain Imaging Study (IBIS) dataset, which contains anatomical images of children from birth to 24 months of age. When you open ITK-Snap, it will prompt you to select a recently opened image, if you have previously used the software. If it is your first time using ITK-Snap, click on ``File -> Open Main Image``, and select the skull-stripped, T1-weighted anatomical image that you have analyzed with infant recon-all.
