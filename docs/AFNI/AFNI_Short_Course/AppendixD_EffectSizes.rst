Appendix D: Reporting Effect Sizes

Overview

Once you have finished analyzing your dataset with AFNI, you may wonder how you should report the results. Within the field of cognitive neuroscience, it is common to report the t-statistic for each effect or each contrast, and to show the results as a t-statistic map overlaid on a template brain. Furthermore, within the tables of a paper, many researchers will report the peak t-statistic of a given cluster.

While this may seem like a reasonable approach - after all, most readers want to know whether a given result is due to chance, and the author has to decide on how to compress the data into some kind of easily understood result - it can also obscure the full picture, and give a distorted view of the practical significance of the result. For example, suppose that a pharmaceutical company advertises a drug that lowers cholesterol. If that was all the information we had, we might assume that the drug has a significant effect, and is worth paying for. If, however, on closer inspection, it is revealed that the drug leads to a drop of just 0.01% in the person's cholesterol, we may reconsider whether the drug is worth taking - and indeed, whether the drug in fact "works" at all. The discriminating buyer would also weigh this against the cost of the drug and its side effects; a drug that lowers cholesterol by 5% and is relatively cheap without any side effects would probably be worth taking, while a drug that lowers cholesterol by 10%, but costs hundreds of dollars per pill and comes with a host of negative side effects, would probably not be worth taking.

Similarly, we should ask ourselves the same question about the effects we observe in the neuroimaging literature: Does this effect exist? Usually some kind of statistic, such as a t-statistic and its associated p-value, allows us to answer that question with some kind of certainty.
