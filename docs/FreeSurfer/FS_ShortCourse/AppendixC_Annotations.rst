Appendix C: Annotating Anatomical Images with Freeview
======================================================

---------------

Overview
********

Freeview, in addition to allowing you to view images and edit them for recon-all, also enables you to **annotate** images. For example, if you want to draw on a T1-weighted anatomical image yourself to trace out where a specific region of the brain is - say, the putamen - you can do so within the Freeview interface.
