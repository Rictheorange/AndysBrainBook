Overview of the Computational Anatomy Toolbox
*********************************************

The Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT) is a software package for measuring brain volume and thickness. Developed by the `Structural Brain Mapping Group <http://www.neuro.uni-jena.de/wordpress/>`__ at the University of Jena in Germany, the toolbox is designed as a toolbox for SPM12 - hence the name of the most recent version, CAT12. It is similar to FreeSurfer, but much faster. Although a study by `Seiger et al. (2018) <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/jon.12521>`__ found that in general CAT12 generates higher thickness estimates than FreeSurfer, the estimates from both packages were significantly correlated, and were able to reliably detect differences in cortical thickness between Alzheimer's patients and healthy controls. (Another comparison study carried about by `Vel√°zquez et al., 2021 <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10548-021-00852-2>`__, found similar results.)

In any case, CAT12 is siginifcantly faster than SPM12, and may be a good alternative software package for some researchers. For example, in addition to being relatively fast, CAT12 also generates useful quality assurance reports in PDF format which quantify, among other metrics, the amount of noise and distortion in the anatomical images. This provides a quick and simple check for whether to exclude particular subjects, and can help determine whether the scanner is producing high- or low-quality data.

The following walkthrough will demonstrate how to use CAT12 with data downloaded from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Consequently, this tutorial will also be one of the first to demonstrate how to analyze data from a large open-access repository focusing on a specific clinical population. We will also learn how to use this toolbox both on your local machine, and how to submit it as a job on a supercomputing cluster.
