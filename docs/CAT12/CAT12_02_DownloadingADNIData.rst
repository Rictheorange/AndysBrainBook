Overview

The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (`ADNI <https://adni.loni.usc.edu/>`__) is a large, open-access database that contains hundreds of brain scans from both healthy controls and people with Alzheimer's. In addition to imaging data, there are several covariates that have been collected for each subject: in addition to basic measurements such as age and years of attending school, there are measurements of cognitive ability, anxiety, depression, and genotypes, such as the presence or absence of the APOE4 allele.

To access the imaging data, click on ``Data & Samples``, and then select ``Access Data and Samples``. This will take you to the access page; scroll down and click on the button ``Apply for ADNI Data``. You will be requested to accept the terms of using their data; select the ``I agree`` radio button, and then click ``Submit``. You will be asked to provide your email address. Upon submitting your address, you will be sent a security code; copy and paste it into the security code field, and click ``Continue``. Fill out the required details, including your name, degree, institution, and a short description of your proposed analysis. In this case, you can enter something like, "I will be analyzing morphometry differences between Alzheimer's patients and control subjects". Click "Continue", and finish the rest of the application. It may take one to two weeks for your application to be reviewed and approved.

Once your application is approved, you will be given a link to the `Laboratory of Neuroimaging (LONI) webpage <https://ida.loni.usc.edu/login.jsp>`__. This webpage, hosted by the USC Mark and Mary Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute, contains the Image & Data Archive (IDA). You will be prompted to create a password; afterwards, whenever you visit the LONI website, click on the ``Login`` button at the top right of the page, and enter your email address and password, and then go to ``My Account``.
