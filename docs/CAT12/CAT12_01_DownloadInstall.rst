CAT Tutorial #1: Download and Install
=====================================

-----------------

The CAT12 toolbox is designed to work with SPM12, using the same libraries for many of its functions. If you haven't already, I recommend working through the :ref:`SPM12 tutorials <SPM_fMRI_Intro>`; in addition to learning how the SPM12 graphical user interface works, which is similar to the CAT12 interface, you will also learn about toolboxes - separate programs that rely on a foundational program, such as SPM12. Just like Marsbar and WFU Pickatlas, for example, CAT12 is another toolbox that will be opened through the SPM GUI.


1. Download and Install SPM
===========================

The download and installation instructions for SPM12 can be found :ref:`here <SPM_fMRI_Intro>`, as well as on the SPM12 website.
